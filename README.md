# Introduction
Natural Bridge State Park is a ~3.5 square mile Kentucky state park located in Slade, KY at 37.7769° N, 83.6884° W. Natural Bridge is a sandstone arch that runs 78 feet across and peaks at 65 feet tall [(source)](https://stateparks.com/natural_bridge_state_park_in_kentucky.html). The goal of this project is to create a virtual experience of Natural Bridge State Park that will create a feeling of reality for viewers from the comfort of their home. Another objective was to accurately depict the contour changes throughout the area of interest to provide additional depth of visualization.
